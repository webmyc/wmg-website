        WMG is an online community for men to explore ancient, contemporary and emergent wisdom inspired by the Gene Keys teaching, so we can empower each other to create profound transformation in our lives.
      </p>
      
      <p class="fade-up">
        It's a space to connect with a brotherhood that recognizes the greatness hidden within each of us—an invitation to reclaim deeper purpose and meaning, and to let our unique genius flourish and transform our lives, our relationships, and the world around us.
      </p>
      
      <p class="fade-up">
        Each month we dive into the sacred journey of being men in modern times and practice aligning with our wholeness—shadows, gifts and siddhis—in how we act, relate, serve and contribute to the harmony and prosperity of all.
